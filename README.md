# Twords

This is a Python implementation of a Ruby program that my daughter and I coded together. We put this one together just for comparison. It's sloppy and inelegant, but at least it has tests.

Incidentally one comparison was interesting - the Python version was 3 to 4 times faster than the Ruby version. I take this as an indication that we did the Ruby version inelegantly too.
